*A multithreaded chat application is a program that allows multiple users to send and receive messages simultaneously. The application uses threads to handle the communication between users, enabling it to handle multiple users concurrently without blocking other users' interactions.In Java, a multithreaded chat application typically relies on sockets for communication between clients and a server. Each client can send messages to the server, and the server can forward those messages to other clients. By using threads, the application can handle multiple clients without causing delays or crashes, as each user can interact independently.This system can be used to create instant messaging applications where multiple users can chat with each other in real-time. For example, chat systems integrated into social media platforms, websites, and mobile apps.Multiplayer games often need a chat system where players can communicate with each other. multithreaded chat application in Java is an essential component.*
